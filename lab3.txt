Problem 1)
This function iterates up to (z, (sz - 1) times, so it is essentially O(n^2).
Problem 2)
I would label each M&M bag 1-20.
I would put onto the scale from each bag, the number of its name.
So for example I would put 1 M&M from bag 1, 2 M&Ms from bag 2, etc.

Then I take the final weight in grams and subtract 210 ( because (1 + 2 +...+ 19 + 20) = 210 )
Then I divide by 0.1 and I am left with the bag number
